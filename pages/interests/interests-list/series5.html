    <p>This drama takes viewers into the housing estates of east London. There is tension between the drug gangs that operate almost openly and those who strive to live honest lives against the odds in the crime-riddled area. That tension is explored through the interlocking stories of 20-something drug dealer Dushane, who is determined to become the area's Top Boy, and good-natured but vulnerable teenager Ra'Nell, who is forced to grow up quickly following his mother's breakdown and enforced absence. The programme combines elements of a tense gangster thriller with subtle social realism, some tenderness, innocence and wry humour.</p>
